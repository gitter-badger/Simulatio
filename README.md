# Physics

This project is a personal challenge that I launched to train me in programming and compiling the c++ language, while learning the basic concepts and functions of 2D physical simulation (applicable to 3D thereafter).

The ultimate goal would be to present an easy-to-use and optimized physical engine, a bit like a simplified "Algodoo"

## Getting Started

In order to run this c ++ program using the SFML graphics library, you will need to meet the conditions for its operation. 

### Prerequisites

To install a c/c++ compilator:

If you are under Windows, I recommend the mingw compiler:
Go to the http://www.mingw.org/ website and click on the Download button. After the download is complete, launch the program and wait for the download to finish. When you get to the "MinGW Installation Manager" page, check all the boxes, then click on the "installation" button and "Apply Changes".

You must then add the environment variable to your compiler:
search for it in the windows search bar and open it, then click on it again in "avanced system parameters". Click on the "Path" field and click on "Edit". You can then "Add" the path to the emplacement of the compiler: Path\to\Compiler\Mingw\bin.

You can try if it worked by writing in a new command
```
gcc
```
If the return is the following, this part work.
```
gcc: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
```

To install the SFML library:
Go to the https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/index-fr.php website and choose the download link.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
