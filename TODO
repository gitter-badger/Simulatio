#TO DO LIST:

#Done:
- System
- Body
- Collisions Between Bodys
- Gravity

#To do
- Colors with interaction strenght
- Rect bodys
- Collisions 
- Strings
- Faster

#Errors
- When right clicke and draw then left click before releasing
- If two object have same mass, x, y, ... they are considered as the same object
- Gravity can work only in one direction, see the associations of pair for gravity
- Crash when references nullptr (non existing objects in the array of dot or contraints)
- Stiffness can't be under 0.3f
- Check for a constraint/struc if a dot from itself is the selected one
- When two elements are created at the same place it can create errors (same with elements placed over another)
- crash when a dot with a constraint is pushed in a fixed one
